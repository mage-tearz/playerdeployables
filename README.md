# playerdeployables
A plugin for impulse by mage.tearz.


This plugin includes a chat command for creating / destroying the turret, and an item for easy deployment.
There is also a hook for destroying the turret on death and team change.

You're gonna need to change the teams specified in hooks and items.
If a citizen deploys the turret, it will attack everyone but citizens.
If an Overwatch unit deploys the turret, it will not attack CPs.
You can add more dependencies in the item code
